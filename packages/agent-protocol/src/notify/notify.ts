/**
 * WHO IS TOLD THAT THE TURN HAS PASSED, AND WHEN (R4, thread `016-protocol-roadmap`).
 *
 * The watch wakes an AGENT. The other direction — "the turn has passed to a human"
 * — lived in `bin/notify.sh`, a bash script in the project zone: it parsed the mail
 * with the shared entry point, but the SET of those notified was the string
 * `NOTIFY_ROLES="john curator"`, the wording of the two cases was a branch inside an
 * awk program, and the texts were Russian prose baked into a script that also knew
 * how to talk to Telegram. Three things in one file, none of them the same thing.
 *
 * They come apart along the lines the package already draws:
 *
 *  - **WHOM to notify is derived from the role model** (P1): `wake.mode: self` is a
 *    human who reads notifications, `via-human` is an assistant with no process of
 *    its own who comes alive only when the named human opens the chat. That is
 *    `registry.notificationTargets()`, and it has carried the comment "the text is
 *    not our business: it is the project's" since P1 — this module is that promise
 *    coming due. A configurable role list is deliberately NOT reintroduced: it would
 *    be a second place to say what the role model already says, and the awk branch
 *    for "some other role" that used to exist for it is dropped with it — with the
 *    set derived, the case cannot occur.
 *  - **WHEN is a change of composition**, not the fact of waiting. A ping every five
 *    minutes about the same thread trains its reader to ignore it.
 *  - **WHAT IS SAID is the project's** — templates, `template.ts`.
 *  - **HOW IT IS DELIVERED is a transport**, a separate package (`transport.ts`).
 *
 * THE TRIGGER IS A NEW PAIR, THE TEXT IS THE FULL COMPOSITION — carried over
 * verbatim from the script, because both halves were paid for. Notify on appearance
 * only, or the same thing arrives every tick; but say ALL of it, because a list of
 * one reads as "everything else is closed", and that would be a lie at the price of
 * a forgotten thread.
 *
 * THE UNIT IS A THREAD, NOT A ROLE (thread 008): a new piece of work for john is a
 * new message even if john was already waiting on something else.

 *
 * - `turn` — a thread is waiting on a human;
 * - `turn-with-nudge` — the same thread is ALSO waiting on an assistant. The script
 *   said this as a suffix ("(the curator is next)") glued on by an awk branch,
 *   because a thread waiting on both is in practice a queue and not a parallel: the
 *   human's move (acceptance, merge, a decision) comes first. Two equal lines about
 *   one id made the reader ask "which one first";
 * - `nudge` — a thread waiting ONLY on an assistant, which means "open the chat and
 *   poke them", because there is no process to wake.
 *

 * ("somebody else is waiting on this thread too") is known to the package, so the
 * package picks the slot and the project writes two plain sentences — rather than
 * the project learning a template language with branches, which is the road to a
